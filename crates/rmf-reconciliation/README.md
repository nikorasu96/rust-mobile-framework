# rmf-reconciliation

Pure core service that assigns runtime node identities and prepares immutable snapshots plus
deterministic host mutation batches. Its only dependency is `rmf-core`; it contains no renderer,
runtime orchestration, Android, JNI or TypeScript concerns.

The current vertical increment supports initial mounting from `ValidatedTree`. Incremental keyed
reconciliation is deliberately rejected with a typed error until its complete identity and
mutation-ordering contract is implemented.

Ownership rules:

- callers borrow the current snapshot and candidate during preparation;
- `PreparedCommit` owns both the batch and unpublished next snapshot;
- committed nodes use parent-to-child `Arc` ownership without parent pointers;
- only `into_snapshot` transfers the prepared state for promotion after host success.
